# PRD Writer — Product Requirements Document Generator

## Trigger
`/prd_writer` or when user says "write a PRD", "create product spec", "draft requirements doc", "feature spec", "product brief", "one-pager", "RFC", "design doc"

## Purpose
Generate professional Product Requirements Documents from scratch, signals, or rough notes. Produces structured, stakeholder-ready specs with acceptance criteria, success metrics, and dependency mapping. Supports multiple PRD formats: one-pager, full PRD, RFC, and lightweight brief.

## Actions

### `write` (default)
Generate a full PRD from user input:

1. **Clarify scope:**
   - Ask: Feature name, target user, problem statement
   - If user provides raw notes/signals, extract these automatically
   - Check `Goals.md` to align with current OKRs

2. **Gather context:**
   - Read `Charter_Areas.md` for ownership and architecture context
   - Read `Action_Items.md` for related open work
   - Check recent signals for supporting evidence
   - If ADO MCP available, pull related work items

3. **Draft PRD using template:**
   - Use `_Automation/prompt_templates/prd_template.md` if it exists
   - Otherwise use the built-in format below
   - Apply PM heuristics: SIMPLICITY, USER SIGNAL, ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, BLAST RADIUS, MEASUREMENT

4. **Save and present:**
   - Save to relevant project folder: `projects/[area]/PRD_[Title]_[Date].md`
   - If project unclear, save to `_Inbox/` for routing
   - Show summary in chat

### `one_pager`
Generate a concise 1-page feature brief:

1. Same context gathering as `write`
2. Strict constraint: max 500 words, 5 sections
3. Format: Problem → Proposal → Success Metric → Risks → Ask
4. Ideal for leadership reviews and executive presentations

### `rfc`
Generate a Request for Comments document:

1. Emphasize alternatives considered, trade-offs, open questions
2. Include "Decision Matrix" comparing options
3. Add "Stakeholder Sign-Off" section with reviewer list
4. Format: Context → Problem → Options → Recommendation → Open Questions → Decision

### `review`
Review and score an existing PRD:

1. Read the PRD file
2. Score against 10-point checklist:
   - [ ] Problem grounded in data (not assumptions)
   - [ ] User signal cited (real feedback, telemetry, or incident)
   - [ ] Acceptance criteria are binary (pass/fail, no ambiguity)
   - [ ] Success metric has a number and timeframe
   - [ ] Dependencies listed with owners
   - [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
   - [ ] Out of scope explicitly stated
   - [ ] One-pager test passes (can summarize in 1 page)
   - [ ] No jargon without definition
   - [ ] Next steps / ask is clear
3. Output: Score (X/10) + specific improvement suggestions

### `from_template`
Generate a PRD from a specific template:

1. List available templates in `_Automation/prompt_templates/`
2. User selects template
3. Fill template fields from context + user input
4. Flag any unfilled fields with ❓

## Context Sources
1. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Goals.md` — OKR alignment
2. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Charter_Areas.md` — Scope and ownership
3. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Action_Items.md` — Related open items
4. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Partners.md` — Partner context if relevant
5. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Signals/` — Recent signals for evidence
6. `_Automation/prompt_templates/prd_template.md` — PRD template (if exists)

## Output Format

### Full PRD
```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Title]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Author** | [Name] |
| **Date** | [Today] |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Charter Area** | [Area] |
| **Related Work** | [ADO IDs / GitHub Issues] |

## Problem Statement
[Grounded in data — cite specific user signals, telemetry, or incidents]

## User Signal
[Evidence: customer feedback, support tickets, telemetry anomalies, competitive pressure]

## Proposed Solution
[Concise description — what, not how]

### User Experience
[Step-by-step user flow or before/after comparison]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Binary criterion — no ambiguity]
- [ ] [Binary criterion]
- [ ] [Binary criterion]

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| [KPI] | [Baseline] | [Goal] | [When] |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Owner | Risk Level |
|------------|-------|------------|
| [Component/Team] | [Name] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 |

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Plan] |

## Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded item]

## Open Questions
- ❓ [Unresolved question — owner, deadline]

## Timeline
| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Spec Approved | [Date] | ⬜ |
| Dev Start | [Date] | ⬜ |
| Dogfood | [Date] | ⬜ |
| GA | [Date] | ⬜ |

## MCP Integration
- **Azure DevOps MCP** — Pull related work items, create linked items from PRD
- **GitHub MCP** — Reference issues, link to repos
- **Work IQ MCP** — Pull team context and related discussions

## Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't write PRDs for vague requests ("make it better") — push back and ask for specifics
- ❌ Don't invent user signals — only cite real data
- ❌ Don't exceed 2 pages for a standard PRD — split into multiple specs
- ❌ Don't skip the success metric — every PRD needs a number
- ❌ Don't merge multiple features into one PRD — one feature, one doc
