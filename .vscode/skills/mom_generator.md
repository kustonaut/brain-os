# MOM Generator — Minutes of Meeting

## Trigger
`/mom` or when user says "meeting minutes", "MOM", "minutes of meeting", "summarize meeting", "meeting summary", "write up the meeting", "capture meeting notes"

## Purpose
Generate structured Minutes of Meeting (MOM) documents from meeting transcripts, notes, or real-time conversation. Extracts decisions, action items, key discussion points, and follow-ups. Outputs professional markdown and optionally Word documents for distribution.

## Actions

### `generate` (default)
Generate MOM from provided input:

1. **Identify source:**
   - User-pasted meeting notes or transcript
   - Transcript file from `*/Transcripts/` folder
   - Calendar context from `calendar_*.md` signals (meeting title, attendees)
   - Real-time dictation/notes from user

2. **Extract structured content:**
   - **Meeting metadata** — Title, date, time, attendees, organizer
   - **Agenda items** — Numbered topics discussed (infer from transcript flow)
   - **Key discussions** — 2-3 sentence summary per agenda item
   - **Decisions made** — What was decided, by whom, rationale
   - **Action items** — Task, owner, deadline, priority
   - **Parking lot** — Items deferred to future meetings
   - **Next meeting** — Date/time if mentioned

3. **Apply formatting:**
   - Professional table for metadata
   - Numbered agenda with discussion summaries
   - Decision callout boxes
   - Action item table with sortable columns
   - Parking lot as bullet list

4. **Route outputs:**
   - Save MOM to project folder: `projects/[area]/MOM_[Meeting]_[Date].md`
   - Extract action items → `Action_Items.md` (with deduplication)
   - Extract new contacts → `Key_Contacts.md` (if unknown people mentioned)

5. **Offer distribution:**
   - "Email MOM to attendees?" → `/m365_email_drafter`
   - "Post summary to Teams?" → `/m365_teams_comms`

### `from_transcript`
Generate MOM specifically from a transcript file:

1. Accept path to transcript (`.txt`, `.vtt`, `.md`)
2. Parse speaker labels if present (e.g., "Speaker 1:", "[John]:")
3. Identify topic transitions and key moments
4. Generate MOM with speaker attribution
5. Flag any unclear sections: "⚠️ Unclear — verify with attendees"

### `template`
Show the MOM template for manual use:

1. Output a blank MOM template in markdown
2. Can be copied into any note-taking app
3. Includes all standard sections with placeholder text

### `batch`
Process multiple transcripts at once:

1. Scan a folder for transcript files
2. Generate a MOM for each
3. Create an index file linking all MOMs
4. Useful for processing a week's worth of meetings

## Context Sources
1. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Signals/calendar_*.md` — Meeting metadata, attendee lists
2. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Key_Contacts.md` — Resolve names to roles
3. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Action_Items.md` — Dedup action items
4. `*/Transcripts/` folders — Meeting transcript files
5. `00_Daily_Intelligence/Knowledge_Base/Charter_Areas.md` — Route to correct project

## Rules
1. **Always confirm before writing to Action_Items.md** — Show extracted items first
2. **Attribute decisions to people** — Every decision needs an owner
3. **Flag uncertainty** — If transcript is unclear, mark with ⚠️
4. **Deduplicate** — Check existing action items before adding new ones
5. **Respect confidentiality** — Don't include sensitive HR/personnel discussions in MOM unless explicitly requested
6. **Include absentees** — Note who was expected but absent (from calendar invite vs. actual attendance)

## Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't fabricate attendee names — only use names from transcript or calendar
- ❌ Don't skip the action items table — every meeting produces at least one action
- ❌ Don't write verbatim transcript — synthesize into summaries
- ❌ Don't ignore the parking lot — deferred items need tracking too
- ❌ Don't over-summarize — keep enough detail that absent attendees understand what happened
