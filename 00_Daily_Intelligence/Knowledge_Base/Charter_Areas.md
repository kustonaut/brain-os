## How Charters Drive Brain OS

1. **Signal routing:** Emails/chats matching charter keywords are tagged automatically
2. **Folder structure:** Each charter maps to a numbered folder (e.g., `01_Project_Alpha/`)
3. **Project tiles:** Portal home page shows each charter as a project card
4. **Metrics:** Per-charter metrics defined in `config.json → projects`
5. **Action items:** Items in `Action_Items.md` are tagged by charter for prioritization
