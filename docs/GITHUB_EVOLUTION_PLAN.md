## 2. Pin These 6 Repos (github.com → Your Profile → Customize Pinned)

| Order | Repo | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| 1 | **brain-os** | Flagship. PM OS. Defines your lane. |
| 2 | **365daysofADX** | Star anchor (37★). Shows teaching instinct. |
| 3 | **kql-cheat-sheet** | Developer utility. Shows you build for others. |
| 4 | **WealthPulse** | Side project. Shows range beyond work. |
| 5 | **StockScreener** | Recent. Shows you're actively building. |
| 6 | **pomodoro-app** | Fun utility. Rounds out the profile. |

---

## 3. Archive These Repos (Settings → Danger Zone → Archive)

These are old forks from 2022-2023 that add noise. Archiving hides them from the main repos view but keeps them accessible.

| Repo | Reason |
|------|--------|
| azure-kusto-labs | Fork, no original contributions |
| azure-kusto-python | Fork, SDK client |
| azure-kusto-java | Fork, SDK client |
| azure-kusto-go | Fork, SDK client |
| azure-kusto-spark | Fork, SDK connector |
| azure-kusto-log4j | Fork, SDK connector |
| azure-kusto-microhack1 | Fork, lab exercise |
| kafka-sink-azure-kusto | Fork, connector |
| logstash-output-kusto | Fork, connector |
| K2Bridge | Fork, Kibana bridge |
| azure-docs | Fork, Microsoft docs |
| dataexplorer-docs | Fork, ADX docs |
| ADX-in-a-Day-Lab2 | Fork, lab exercise |
| just-another-kusto-hacker | Fork, JAKH puzzles |
| ADX-IoT-Analytics-Solution-Accelerator | Fork, accelerator |
| KQL | Fork, KQL samples |

**Keep but don't pin:**
- `telegraf-fabric-ingestion` — original, shows Fabric integration skills
- `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` — fork but shows observability interest
- `telegraf` — fork, keep for reference
- `landscape` — CNCF landscape fork, shows cloud-native awareness
- `core` — Home Assistant fork, shows IoT interest

## 4. Profile README Setup

1. Create a new repo: `kustonaut/kustonaut` (must match your username exactly)
2. Check "Add a README" during creation
3. Replace the content with the file at: `brain-os/docs/github_profile_README.md`
4. Commit and push

The README will automatically render on your GitHub profile page.
