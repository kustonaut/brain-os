## Problem Statement

Users receive notifications across 4 separate channels (in-app, email, Teams, mobile push) with no centralized view. Support data shows 34% of escalations stem from "missed notification" — users didn't see a critical alert because it arrived in the wrong channel at the wrong time. Weekly active notification dismissal rate is 78%, suggesting notification fatigue from duplicates.

## User Signal

- **Support tickets:** 142 tickets in Q4 2025 tagged "missed alert" or "notification not received"
- **User research (N=28):** 89% of participants said "I miss important updates because there are too many unimportant ones"
- **Telemetry:** Average user receives 47 notifications/day; opens only 6 (12.7% engagement rate)
- **Competitive:** Figma, Linear, and Notion all shipped unified notification centers in 2025

## Proposed Solution

A single **Notification Center** panel accessible from the global header that:
1. Aggregates all notification types into one feed
2. Allows priority-based filtering (Critical / Important / FYI)
3. Supports "Do Not Disturb" scheduling with smart escalation
4. Provides daily digest option for low-priority items
5. Remembers per-category preferences across sessions

### User Experience

**Before:**
```
User opens app → checks in-app bell → checks email → checks Teams → checks mobile
→ Still misses the one critical alert buried in 47 notifications
```

**After:**
```
User opens app → Notification Center badge shows "2 critical"
→ Clicks → sees prioritized feed → acts on critical items → bulk-dismisses FYI
→ Zero missed escalations
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All notification types appear in a single unified feed
- [ ] User can filter by priority level (Critical / Important / FYI)
- [ ] "Do Not Disturb" mode suppresses non-critical notifications for a configurable duration
- [ ] Critical notifications bypass DND and appear with visual + audio alert
- [ ] Daily digest email consolidates all FYI notifications from the past 24h
- [ ] User preferences persist across sessions and devices
- [ ] Feed loads in < 200ms for up to 500 notifications
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter, Escape, arrow keys)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Notification engagement rate | 12.7% | 35% | 90 days post-launch |
| "Missed alert" support tickets | 142/quarter | < 50/quarter | 1 quarter post-launch |
| Notification dismissal rate | 78% | < 40% | 90 days post-launch |
| User satisfaction (CSAT) | 3.2/5 | 4.0/5 | 90 days post-launch |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Owner | Risk Level |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Notification Service API v2 | Platform Team | 🟡 Medium — API in beta |
| Push notification infrastructure | Mobile Team | 🟢 Low — stable |
| User preference storage | Identity Team | 🟢 Low — existing system |
| Email digest service | Comms Team | 🟡 Medium — needs new template |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| API v2 delays | Medium | High | Implement with v1 fallback; v2 features as fast-follow |
| Notification fatigue persists | Low | Medium | A/B test priority algorithm before full rollout |
| Cross-device sync latency | Medium | Low | Accept 5s sync delay; show "syncing" indicator |
| Accessibility gaps | Low | High | Include accessibility review in design phase |

## Out of Scope

- Custom notification sounds/ringtones (v2 consideration)
- AI-powered notification summarization (v2 consideration)
- Third-party notification sources (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Admin-level notification policies (separate admin PRD needed)

## Open Questions

- ❓ Should "Critical" classification be sender-defined or ML-based? — Owner: PM, Due: Sprint 1
- ❓ What's the max notification retention period? (7 days? 30 days?) — Owner: Engineering, Due: Design Review
- ❓ Do we need an API for external systems to mark notifications as "Critical"? — Owner: Platform, Due: Sprint 2
